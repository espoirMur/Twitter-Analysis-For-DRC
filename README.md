# Twitter-Analysis-For-DRC


I really don't know how to name this project , I just want to work on something related to social media data analysis for DRCongo.

Basically, In this project the ideas is to collect tweet related to DRC analyze and check what we can do with them.

Some interesting topics we could do are :

- Sentiment analysis of comment to a particular topic.
- Content analysis , with this I mean trying to understand what Congelese are talking about on social media.
- Disease prevention using social media analysis.
- Another interesting will be to use the streaming api to fetch data daily and retrieve what people are talking about.

- Basically using time series analysis to predict ebola outbreak in a region.


I will be sharing more topics with time.

Some resources I'm using are :
